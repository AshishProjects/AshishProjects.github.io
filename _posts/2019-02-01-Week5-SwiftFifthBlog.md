# [Swift]({% post_url 2019-02-01-Week5-SwiftFifthBlog %})
Completed the application however, i was not able to resolve few errors.
I learned how to resolve constranints, and applying background colors.

It was a great experience. i have learned a lot

I will grade my self 6 out of 10 considering i have no idea about Xcode and swift
