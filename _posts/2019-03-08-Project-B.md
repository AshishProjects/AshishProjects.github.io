###  Schedule Calendar
     The schedule Calendar have form that accept entries and show those entries in 
     the calendar.
     I have created a page called index.js which contain the form and state variable, which stores
     entered data.Then I pass this data to Calendar.js(Which is in component file). Then the calendar
     show that data on the calendar.
     I have used different plugins like react dom next, @zeit/next-css, react-big-calendar, isomorphic-unfetch etc
### Lessons Learned
    -- It is very important to understand the react js life cycle to know who to functions and 
       other components interact.
    -- Next Js is a powerful framework and can make really good web applications.
    
### Unexpected Challenges
    I had lot of issues while creating the web application because it was all new to me.
    The main issue was to run big Calendar on server because it was giving error (Window not defined).
    it was because first I was trying to add calendar in the page folder but it was suppose to be a 
    part of the component.
    There is a lot to learn and i will continue do that.
