### Week-4
# [Swift]({% post_url 2019-02-01-Week4-SwiftForthBlog %})

This week my progress was slow because I had lot of issues with the code. However,
on the flip side resolving the errors increased my understanding about the swift and xcode.
I had never thought building a mobile application will be a new experience.
Though, there are a lot of things I neef to learn to improve.

## Advance calculator
I am planning to build an application which will do siple arthemetic calculations and 
will also have inbuilt functions that will help user to calculati area and other parameters.
